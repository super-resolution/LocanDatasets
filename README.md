# LocanDatasets

This repository holds example datasets from super-resolution microscopy.

## Available datasets:


1) Single-molecule localization microscopy data representing nuclear pore complexes.

    The data was generated by dSTORM as described in [Löschberger et al.](doi:10.1242/jcs.098822).
    It shows the gp210 protein of the nuclear pore complex labeled with AlexaFluor647.

2) Single-molecule localization microscopy representing microtubules.

    The data was generated by dSTORM as described in [Helmerich et al.](doi:10.1021/acsnano.0c06099).
    It shows alpha-tubulin as part of microtubules within COS-7 cells.
    Tubulin was targeted by primary IgG-antibodies labeled with AlexaFluor647 (2.1 degree of labeling)
    and recorded over 75_000 frames.
